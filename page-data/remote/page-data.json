Roughly 2\nweeks ago, the company I worked for went “remote first”, and in terms of work,\nthings are starting to get back to usual (well, as usual as it can get). So\ntoday, I’d like to write down some of my first impressions of the whole\nsituation so far!</p>\n<h3>How it went down (simplified)</h3>\n<p>Even before Berlin starts getting it’s first COVID-19 case, there has been a\nbunch of people asking if the company’s policy about WFH and other preventive\nmeasures are gonna adapt to it. And after Berlin has it’s first confirmed case,\nit takes a few more days until the management establishes official news source.\nAnd a few more days (&#x26; a lot of messages on the chat room) later, the company\nheld a basically impromptu-all-hands in the morning, and announced the procedure\nof how to “apply” for WFH for most employees. And the next thing you know, half\nthe people are gone before lunch.</p>\n<h3>Perception of remote working before this</h3>\n<p>I have been living in Berlin for 3 years now, and worked in multiple companies\nas full time employee, in their office, at least 9–5. I am now mostly used to\nit, but I don’t think I ever really liked it.</p>\n<p>I like being able to easily make friends at work, but I don’t like waking up\nwhen it’s one of those days where I just don’t feel like socializing at all.</p>\n<p>I like that it forces me to have a consistent schedule and lifestyle, but I\ndon’t really enjoy the hours being so inflexible, given my work is not really\ntime-specific.</p>\n<p>I like that an office provides a safe space in terms of productivity (usually),\nbut I hate having to spend 1+ hour each day on the commute.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TL;DR: I never <strong>hate</strong> showing up to office per se, but I have a list of\nthings I can complain about.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>The first 24 hours of “OK you work from home now”</h3>\n<p>Even though I was one of the people who tried to push the company to adopt WFH\nas soon as possible (i.e. “wrote on the super long COVID-19 thread to keep the\nconversation going”), the sudden announcement still throws me off. I spend\nbasically the whole afternoon planning what do I have to do to get my room\nready, and try to organize the work to make sure I won’t forget anything\n(although this didn’t really work because I was so distracted the entire time).</p>\n<p>I left office a bit later than usual to try to avoid the crowd, and then I went\nto supermarket to get enough groceries for a week, and tried to go get a\nmicrophone for all the video chat (although the store was out of the cheap one).\nThe last thing I did before officially working remotely is that on the next day\nat 7AM, I planned out how I am gonna move the furnitures in my room around to\nhave a more separate work &#x26; rest place (sorry downstairs neighbors). Living in\na tiny room in a share flat in the middle of a pandemic is not ideal.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TL;DR: Chaotic</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>What happens in the next week</h3>\n<p>In terms of the work itself, things are quite typical, since it is such a short\nnotice, we are not really prepared to adapt anything to be more remote friendly.\nWe still have a lot of meetings, but with video chat instead of face-to-face.\nIt’s ever so slightly worse than what I usually experience.</p>\n<p>In terms of productivity, I’d say I am able to focus around 60% of the time.\nThere is only so much you can do to improve your home office in such short\nnotice. And I tried to compensate for it with working extra hours, which ever\nso slightly cancel out my reduced productivity (but not sustainable at all).</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 42.567567567567565%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"comic\"\n        title=\"comic\"\n        src=\"/static/c880311a8eabfcdfab54eed20d61fa9d/294ce/comic.jpg\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span><figcaption>Thiscomic from Alex Norris speaks to my soul: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nadiaoxford/status/1239588500212789248\">https://twitter.com/nadiaoxford/status/1239588500212789248</a></figcaption></p>\n<p>The biggest change probably happens in terms of my sanity. This sheer amount of\nnews around the pandemic drives my stress level high already, combine with\nissues with the work itself with a tight deadline that actually needs to be met\nor “shit might go down”, and me trying to compensate it with extra work hour, is\ndriving my mood to an all time low.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TL;DR: Externally business as usual, internally pulling my hairs out</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Now what?</h3>\n<p>Knowing that I will be stuck on this chair for a while, I am starting to plan\nhow am I gonna survive this without going me insane (if I am not already\ninsane).</p>\n<p>First thing I did: online shopping. If all the advertisements have taught me\nanything, it is “buy this product and your problem will go away”. I am now aware\nof how much “useless” things I just bought, and I am doing a slightly better job\nat controlling my spending habit than a week ago. But I do need to make a few\nadjustments to the physical environments, and I am fortunate enough to have some\nsaving &#x26; incomes to do just that.</p>\n<p>Next thing I did: spend a lot of time on the internet to try to figure out how\nWFH usually work. What should I expect (under normal circumstances), how should\nI adjust that expectation based on the situation, how people usually work, etc.\nOne of the thing that kinda blows my mind is the <a href=\"https://www.pscp.tv/w/1nAKEdbbnPgxL\">Q&#x26;A session by David\nHeinemeier Hansson and Jason Fried from\nBasecamp</a>. While some of it do feel a bit\ntoo much like an ad for Basecamp, I think the rest is a good short summary of\nwhat a team of expert remote workers is experiencing, along with how newly\nremote workers can/should expect.</p>\n<p>While I am coming up with a list of improvements for my surrounds physically, I\nalso started to think about how to change my behavior to reduce my stress level,\nso that I don’t have to pull my hairs out.</p>\n<h4>Workout</h4>\n<p>A lot of people have suggested that keeping your workout routine is very\nhelpful, and I will try to do some quick research on what body weight exercise\ncan I do in such a tiny space. I haven’t do much body weight exercise since my\nUni days.</p>\n<h4>“Separation of concerns”</h4>\n<p>A lot of people also suggested to keep your work space and personal space\nseparate. While it’s physically hard to do in my tiny room, I can kinda achieve\nthat by removing all work-related items from my sight (all notes, computer,\naccessories, etc.) when the day is over, and let my laziness do the the rest\n(a.k.a. “Nah I am too lazy to move the chair and take the computer back out. I\nwill check it tomorrow”)</p>\n<h4>Clean your room/apartment/mansion/whatever</h4>\n<p>A lot of people suggested to keep your space tidy, plus the act of tidying can\ndouble as a distraction. That’s just a good idea in general, especially now that\nwe are all spending 24 hours in the apartment everyday.</p>\n<h4>Spend less time on internet</h4>\n<p>First I have to say I love the internet, without it I would be absolutely\nuseless. But in the last few months, the amount of time I spent reading COVID-19\nrelated news is pretty much inversely proportional to my mood.</p>\n<p>Back in 2003 when SARS was hitting Hong Kong, I remember everyone can’t stop\nwatching the news, and it drives everyone into panic mode. And this time around,\nit started for me back in Jan-Feb, when my family and friends in Hong Kong are\npanicking on how they are gonna get enough masks, and pretty much my entire\ninstagram feed is about how people are trying to keep themselves safe (from the\nvirus or the police, or both). And when cases start to appear in Europe, I just\ncan’t stop scrolling on Twitter and panic.</p>\n<p>And even if you find the news about COVID-19 useful, there is still a huge\nproblem of misinformation being share around, from random obfuscated screenshots\non Instagram, to actual leaders of multiple countries (yes of course I am\nreferring to Trump). One of the most vivid memory I have is that in the early\ndays of the spread in Hong Kong, no one actually knows what the symptom should\nbe, how they spread (WHO were saying “human to human transmission is unlikely”),\nand someone share a (later to be proven fake/taken out of context) video, of a\nmen puking blood on some China subway/underground/U-Bahn/MTR, for like a full\nminute straight. That was really disturbing, not because of the visual, but the\nidea of “what if this happens to people I care about”. I was (and still am) not\nprepared for this. I just can’t stop thinking about it and focus at work for 2\ndays straight.</p>\n<p>I think it’s safe to say I should spend a lot less time on the internet.</p>\n<h4>Take up some new hobbies/pick up some old hobbies</h4>\n<p>Now that I promise to spend less time on the internet, I’d need some other form\nof distractions. Some of my recent hobby-building purchase (i.e. online shopping\nspree) includes buying a Nikon FM (i.e. an old-school film camera from the 70s?),\nsome books (currently reading\n<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42086897-how-to\">how to by <em>Randall Monroe</em></a>),\nand a decent speaker set (Creative T40 II to be exact. I am not an audiophile I\njust bought it because my work computer speaker starts cracking). Each of them\nshould be enough distraction for quite a while.</p>\n<p>There are also hobbies that does not involve extra spending, like writing,\nplaying some instruments (A lot of people probably have an instrument laying\naround), or cooking (you have to eat everyday anyway, might as well make your\nfood better).</p>\n<p>We are all gonna be stuck here for a while, and by we I mean those who are\nprivileged enough to work from home. The best we can do is to buy scientist\nand manufactures time to develop the vaccine and more effective cure, to help\nkeep those who cannot work from home as safe as possible. In the day and age\nwhen both the physical world and digital world is plague with danger, it would\nbe my first step to figure out how I can embrace remote working and get my\nsanity back on track.</p>\n<p>Stay safe!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Went from “liking tweets about remote working” to “being 100% remote” in 1 day","date":"April 08, 2020","description":"TL;DR: stay safe"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/remote/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/compose-4/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mental Models of Jetpack Compose #4: Components and Hindsight"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/photo-2020/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Am I still taking photos in 2020?
