# Gadget list (August 2018)

A few days back, I set down and list out all of my gadgets down (again) to try to get my shit together. Here‚Äôs what I have and what I will do with them:

* ThinkPad T480: Main workstation (Development focus)

* Google Pixel 2: Daily driver

* MacBook Air 11 (early 2014): Secondary workstation (Design focus + iOS development)

* iPhone SE: iOS driver, development device

* Nokia 1: Android development device (Building for billions y‚Äôall)

* reMarkable: Note taking tablet, still not sure if I will return it or not (Whether I keep it or not, I will probably write a blog post about it)

* Misfit Vapor: Not working, send backed to Fossil for repair

* ChefSteps Joule: Sous Vide machine, still not sure if I will return it or not, but I guess if it doesn‚Äôt work out for me, it would be a decent gift for my family (especially for all the intensive holiday cooking)

There are also some gadgets on hiatus because of the stupid apartment that I am staying in have electrical problem (no power from wall sockets in my room üòë):

* Dell U2515H

* Google Home mini

This list is actually shorter than the one I wrote a few months back, and that‚Äôs because I have decided to sell off a bunch of my stuff that I don‚Äôt actually use/are just not worth it:

* Medion Chromebook S2013: 32-bit ARM Chromebook with [‚Äúpromised‚Äù Android app support that never come](https://www.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/8q6gjm/its_mid2018_and_there_are_still_35_devices_with/), and [no chance of getting Linux container,](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/containers_and_vms.md#32_bit-ARM-CPUs) no wonder why it has been sitting in my drawer for weeks.

* iPad mini 2: It‚Äôs almost exclusively a YouTube machine, which I am trying to reduce. And when the time comes for me to make iPad apps, iPad mini 2 will be extremely outdated.

* Sony a6000 + 16‚Äì50mm kit lens + Sigma 30mm f/2.8: One of the reason I bought it is because I though the weight of D7000 is preventing me from taking pictures, while the reality is that I am just not that into photography anymore. Plus ever since I got the Pixel 2, the camera has been so great, it makes a6000 unnecessary in a lot of my use cases (i.e. landscapes. I almost exclusively do landscape)

* Sony MDR-ZX770BN: I am just not comfortable enough (mentally) to use it. It just does not work well with my spiky hair. I‚Äôm just waiting for a replacement 3.5mm cable to arrive, and then I can sell it back out.

* Kindle Paperwhite: Even if I decided to return reMarkable, I just don‚Äôt use the paperwhite often enough. At this moment I spent most of my reading time with more textbook type stuff, and Kindle is just not big enough.

* Amazon Fire table: I have not used it in months, and I don‚Äôt have plans to release app on Amazon App Store anytime soon anyway.

* Canon CP1200: I just don‚Äôt use it often enough. And printing postcards are not cheap either.

* GoPro HERO4 Session: I don‚Äôt even remember when is the last time I touch it.

* Daydream View: What was I thinking when I though I would make VR apps!?

Last but not least, there are 2 devices that I don‚Äôt really think I can get rid of:

* Nextbit Robin: I lost the SIM tray

* Nexus 5: It‚Äôs so scratched up in every single corner, plus it‚Äôs super outdated.

And 2 devices that are still undetermined:

* Logitech K380 keyboard: It depends on my next workplace & apartment

* Rapoo 7100P mouse: It depends on my next workplace & apartment

## What did we learn?

* This guy have way too many impulse purchase

* This guy might have money management issue that he has to deal with ASAP
